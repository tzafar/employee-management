Please pick a challenge according to your seniority level.

We also added some guidelines to clarify our expectations from your submission, please look through them before you start working on your assignment.

```
Note: we advise against picking a challenge above your seniority level,
it will be much harder to pass the assignment if you do,
besides there are additional interview rounds where we will be able to gauge your seniority more accurately so this extra effort might not pay off.

But if you feel confident about your skills, by all means, go ahead!
```


We wish you good luck!
